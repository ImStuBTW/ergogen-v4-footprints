# A Selection of Ergogen v4 Footprints

Tailormade in the fashion of today.

## Microcontrollers

* [xiao-ble.js](./xiao-ble.js) - A footprint for the [Seeedstudio XIAO nRF52840](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html). Uses smd pads for the standard GPIO pads. For the interior SW pins, Reset pin, Battery pins, and NFC pins, the footprint features through-hole pins. The pins intersect with small edge cut windows so that you can solder them from the underside of a PCB.
