# A Selection of Ergogen v4 Footprints

Tailormade in the fashion of today.

* [xiao-ble.js](https://github.com/ImStuBTW/ergogen-v4-footprints/blob/main/xiao-ble.js) - A footprint for the Seeedstudio XIAO nRF52840. Uses smd pads for the standard GPIO pads. For the interior SW pins, Reset pin, Battery pins, and NFC pins, the footprint features through-hole pins. The pins intersect with small edge cut windows so that you can solder them from the underside of a PCB.
